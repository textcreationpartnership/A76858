            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Thurſday being the ſecond of <hi>Decemb.</hi> the chiefe Commander of the Rebels <hi>Maqueres,</hi> marched toward <hi>Kilkanie</hi> with intent to plunder it, but Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> having had intelligence of his purpoſe, with all ſpeed rais'd the Proteſtants that were reſident in thoſe parts, encouraging them to make reſiſtance, who were already reſolved, rather to dye in defence of their Chriſtian liberties, then to live in ſervitude to the Papiſts cruelty, yet nevertheleſſe, Sir <hi>Thomas Moores</hi> pious and Heroick exhortations made them more confident, and added wings of expedition to their wiſht deſign, ſo that in one three houres there were aſſembled above 3000 Proteſtants armed with offenſive armes though not defenſive, indeed, they had a confidence in God, whoſe power they knew could ſhield them; therefore thus armed as they were, they marcht in order toward <hi>Kilkanie,</hi> where being once arrived, they found the Town ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:125544:3"/>a weake reſiſtance, but <hi>Maqueers</hi> being ſtrong in men and Ammunition (which he obtaind when he ſurpris'd the <hi>Neweries</hi>) fell on moſt fiercely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a paſſage, deſpight of their reſiſtance, on both ſides men were ſlaine, whoſe Carkcaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrewed their mothers boſome, the earth wept in blood to ſee, her natiue children foſter crueltie, each trod the wine preſſe of rebellious wrath, Death triumpht in his colours, this bloodie conflict made the earth appeare a <hi>Marian Golgotha,</hi> the ground had chang'd it's verdant Liuerie, and put on Scarlet, it was roab'd in blood, the Sunne did hide it's glorious Rayes, the heauens were mantled in a dusky cloud mixt with ſome ſtreakes of red, which ſeem'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the bluſhing of the skye, to ſee man vſe ſuch inhumanity. Death and Deſtruction reveld in the fight, for each man there did ſtriue, who firſt ſhould die, thinking it baſe to liue ſubiect to fortunes ſcorn.</p>
            <p>Vnto this doubtfull Combate ſoone arrived Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> and his aſſociates, who with a ſierce alarum fell vppon the reere of thoſe Rebellious Papiſts, who had almoſt obtaind an en trance into <hi>Kilkanie,</hi> but finding that they were ſurpriſed, and that Sr. <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> was at their heeles, they left the towne, and drew themſelues into a Compleate body, fronting thoſe new come forces with ſuch courage: as if it were a pleaſure unto them to ſpill poore Proteſtants blood.</p>
            <p>The Battell ioynd, and many men lay gaſping on the ground on either ſide, eſpecially the Rebels, for the Proteſtant forces being in two diviſions, did ſo beſtirre them, that had not <hi>Maqueers</hi> his heeles
<pb facs="tcp:125544:3"/>beene better then his hands, he had happily beene higher by the head then he is; in breife, it pleaſed God of his abundant mercy ſo to bleſſe the poore Proteſtants, that though their foes were three for one in number, yet they had the Victory and their foes were put to flight, onely there was ſlain almoſt 300 Rebels, and many taken priſoners which plead that it was contrary to their wills to ſerue, onely they were forced by <hi>Macqueers,</hi> who they ſay in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place that hee comes in forces the Kerns to ſerve him, threatning to ſeale their deniall with death, and by that meanes fortifies and ſtrengthens himſelfe, and his adherents, animating them on to miſchiefe of all ſorts and degrees, to wit, Rapes, Murthers, and moſt Inhumane and inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts, gilding over all their Vices with a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhew of Religion, calling their warre a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warre, nay they are ſo impudent that they ſay they are warranted by their holy Father, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Pope.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe many outrages are daily committed by thoſe Rebels, which are diſperſt about the South-Weſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the intent that they may breed Commotions and diſturbe the Kingdome, and have the greater poſſibility to obtaine their deſires, which J truſt to God will never have any period, except it be in their owne ruines, I beſeech thee O Lord let them fall themſelves into that pit of deſtruction which they provided for us,</p>

            <p>It chanced the next day after the flight of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels from <hi>Kilkanie,</hi> that 7.
